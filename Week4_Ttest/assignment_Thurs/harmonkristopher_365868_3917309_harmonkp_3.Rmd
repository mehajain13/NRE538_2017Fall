### Exercise 1
# Ho 1 tailed: Is the robbery rate in MI greater than the US average of 234 per 10^5?
mean(guns$robbery)
t.test(guns.mi[,"robbery"], mu=234, alternative = 'greater')
# Reject null hypothesis, the MI rate is 233.9, p-value = 0.503

# Ho 2 tailed: Is the violent crame rate in MI the same as the US average of 503 per 10^5?
mean(guns$violent)
t.test(guns.mi[,"violent"], mu=503)
# Reject null hypothesis, the MI average is 695, p-val = 1.002e-10

### Exercise 2
guns.WAS=subset(guns, state=="Washington")
guns.MIN=subset(guns, state=="Minnesota")
t.test(guns.WAS$murder, guns.MIN$murder, paired = F)$p.value
#p-val: 1.545712e-15
