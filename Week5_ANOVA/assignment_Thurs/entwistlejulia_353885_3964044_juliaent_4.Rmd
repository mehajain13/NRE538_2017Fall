# Exercise 1
#Extract the effect size of each factor (i.e. Treatment and Type) with $. Make sure that you comment on the results. Use CO2 data

```{r}
CO2.aov1 = aov(uptake~Treatment, data=CO2)
A = model.tables(CO2.aov1, "effects", se=TRUE)$tables
A$Treatment

CO2.aov2 = aov(uptake~Type, data=CO2)
A = model.tables(CO2.aov2, "effects", se=TRUE)$tables
A$Type
```

#The effects of the model table is the difference of that mean of that treatment group. The grand mean is the average of the averages.

#Exercise 2
#I?€™ve showed you one of multiple ways to do this two way ANOVA. Can you do it with lm() function and summarize (and interpret) it?

```{r}
CO2.aov = lm(uptake~Treatment + Type, data = CO2)
summary(CO2.aov)
```

# The four marginal means show that there is a significant difference. There is a greater effect between nonchilled and chilled Quebec than nonchilled and chilled Mississippi.
