#When I increased the amount of noise in both the X1 and X2 equations by increasing the max to 15, the correlation between the two variables dropped to 0.27.
#So if we look at X1 and X2 when both are included in the regression model, the regression coefficients for both are closer to the true values and not far off like they were when X1 and X2 were highly correlated
#My R2 also increased slightly, since it was considering two variables instead of 1.

summary(mod3)
anova(mod1, mod2)
# Since mod2's p<0.05, mod2 explains a significantly greater amount of variance compared to mod1
anova(mod1, mod2, mod3)
# Since mod3's p<0.05 and is smaller than mod2's p value, mod 3 explains a significantly different amount of variance compared to mod1 and mod2
vif.rad = 1/(1 - summary(lm(Temp~Wind+Solar.R+Ozone, dat=aq))$r.squared)
vif.rad #1.999
# Since our VIF is less than 3, there is not much collinearity and therefore we have reasonable estimates of our regression coefficients
# Overall, mod3 does explain more variance than mod1 or mod2

aic2=AIC(mod2)
aic2 #aic2 = 782.68
aic3=AIC(mod3)
aic3 #aic3 = 747.58
# Since model 3 has the lowest AIC value, I would conclude that it is the best performing model
# Since there is more than a difference of 10 between the AIC values of model 3 v. model 1 or 2, it does perform significantly better than either of those models
