#Check Residual Independency

#Durbin-Watson test
#data:  ozone_mod
#DW = 1.1833, p-value = 7.276e-06
#alternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is not 0

#The Durbin-Watson test confirms what plotting the residuals seems to show: their is a spatial pattern (autocorrelation) in the data.In other words, the data is not indpendent.  
#This is what a low p-value on the Durbin-Watson test indicates, and the test shows ozone_mod to have a very low p-value. 

#Check Homoscadicity
plot(ozone_mod, which=c(1))
#This plot helps to see whether the variance of residuals is constant. As the points are not evenly distributed 
#across the plot, the graph suggest the variance of the residuals is not constant. 
bptest(ozone_mod)
#studentized Breusch-Pagan test
#data:  ozone_mod
#BP = 3.2346, df = 1, p-value = 0.0721

#This test checks to see if the variance is constant. The lower the p-value, the more constant the variance. 
#These results show a p-value higher than 0.05, suggesting that the variance of the residuals is not as constant 
#as we would like (p-valueâ‰¤0.05)

#Check Normality
qqnorm(residuals(ozone_mod))

shapiro.test(residuals(ozone_mod))
#Shapiro-Wilk normality test
#data:  residuals(ozone_mod)
#W = 0.94867, p-value = 0.000226

#These results suggest the data is not quite normal, as the data deviates from the qqplot line 
#and the shapiro-wilkes test has a low p-value.
