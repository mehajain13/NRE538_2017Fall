1. dwtest
From the dwtest, we can only say there is autocorrelation or not. But always keep in mind that this is only one of the structure that should be inspected.

2. bptest
Good explanation:
plot(residuals(mod4)~fitted(mod4))
abline(lm(residuals(mod4)~fitted(mod4)), col="red")
##it looks like there is a pattern in the varience of the residuals
library(lmtest)
bptest(mod4)
#The p value is about 0.07 so there is a fair chance that there is a pattern

3. shapiro test



#The results of our tests suggest that the data displays homoscedasticity which is great, 
#but also displays autocorrelation, and is not normally distributed. Therefore, a linear model using ozone
#as an indepedent variable may not be the best option.
