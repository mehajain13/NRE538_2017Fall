# Exercise 1
# Try to use the following data set to execute ANCOVA and make interaction plots 
# This data set contains the fruit weight (Fruit) of different plants with different root depth (root) and different treatment (Grazing).

interplot(m=mod,var1 = "Root", var2 = "Grazing")+labs(x="root depth",y="estimated coefficient of grazing", title="Estimated coefficient of grazing on root depth")

interplot(m=mod,var1 = "Grazing", var2 = "Root")+labs(x="treatment", y="estimated coefficient of root depth", title="Estimated coefficient of root depth on treatment")

# From the result, Fruit weight = -125.173 + 23.240(Root deepth) + 30.806(treatment) + 0.756(root deepth)(treatment)
# Which means the intercept is -125.173, when root deepth and treatment are both zero 
# For grazing treatment, a unit of increase in root deepth will result in 23.240 units of increase in fruit weight
# For ungrazed treatment, a unit of increase in root deepth will result in 23.240+0.756= 23.996 units of increase in fruit weight 
# From the first interplot, the difference between the dots is 0.756 which represents under different treatment, the difference on effect of root depth to fruit weight
# From the second interplot, the slope of the line is 0.756 which represents under different treatment, the difference on effect of root depth to fruit weight
# However, the p-value for both treatment and interaction are not significant which means their explainary effect are dominated by Root deepth, so the effect is negligible

# Exercise 2
# Use F-test to compare mod.1 and mod.2. Explain why you chose one over another to explain the data.

anova(mod1,mod2)
# From the variance table, since the probability that mod2 can explain the same variance with mod1 is very small (p-value is significant),
# so mod2 is explaining different variance
# Also, mod2 has a lower RSS, which means it has more predictable sum of square than mod1

# Plot two interaction plots with interplot() for the model with wind and solar radiation as the independent variables. Interprete the two interaction plots.

# the effect of solar.R on temperature decrease with a slope of -0.00065. 
# slope of solar.R = 0.0328-0.00065*wind
# The interaction term here is not significant since the p value is 0.7537 (>0.05),
# And also from the graph, we can draw a horizontal line within the grey area that represents the confidence interval
