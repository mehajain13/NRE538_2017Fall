Ex 1. 

1. Root length has a significantly positive effect (23.24) on fruit weight. Ungrazed treatment has almost significant higher fruit weight than grazed treatment. [Note that I wrote the above interpreation because the interaction term is not significant.]
The effects (i.e. regression coefficient) of root length (grazing treatment) is not being influenced by grazing treatment (root length) and vice versa.  

2. The interaction will not change. Interaction is the influence of one variable on the regression coefficient of the other variable. 



##### REVIEW
Three critical assumptions of t-test are:
1. samples have equal variance
2. samples are normally distributed
3. each observation is sampled independently

lm() for linear regression and ANOVA

cor()

linear model check:
1. residual independency (possibly with the dwtest) 
2. residual homoscedasticity (possibly with the bptest) 
3. residual normality (possibly with the shapiro.test)

Model comparison:
F-test:¡@anova()
AIC()

ANCOVA
