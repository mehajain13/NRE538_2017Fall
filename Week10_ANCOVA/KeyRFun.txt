2. samples are normally distributed
3. each observation is sampled independently

lm() for linear regression and ANOVA

cor()

linear model check:
1. residual independency (possibly with the dwtest) 
2. residual homoscedasticity (possibly with the bptest) 
3. residual normality (possibly with the shapiro.test)

Model comparison:
F-test:¡@anova()
AIC()
